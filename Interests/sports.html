        <p><strong> Gaelic Football is a passion of mine. I currently play with the U.C.C Freshers team and my local team Fermoy. There is a strong history of the sport in my family and lining out with my brother for our hometown is a special feeling. Gaelic Football in Fermoy is on the way up with two county championships in the last for years and hopefully we will be a senior football club by next year.</p>
