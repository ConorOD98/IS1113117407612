    <h1>Salesforce as a Service (SaaS)</h1>
    
    <h7>Service Cloud is a customer service and support application. It helps keep your customers happy and your support team sane, whether your customers reach out to you by email, phone, social media, online communities, or real-time Web chat. These different ways of reaching out are called channels, and they help you help your customers through their preferred communication tool. Giving your customers a choice in how they communicate with your company is the first step towards delivering extraordinary service.

The second step to delivering extraordinary service is making sure that your support team can work comfortably with multiple channels simultaneously. The last thing you want to do is burn out your support agents with a complicated app frustrated support agents don’t provide first-rate service. That’s why Service Cloud integrates multiple channels into an easy to use help desk called the console, which you can customize to fit your company’s unique support processes.</h7>
