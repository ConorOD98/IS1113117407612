	 <div> <h1> Salesforce as a Service</h1></div>
	 Service Cloud is a customer service and support application. It helps keep your customers happy and your support team sane, whether your customers reach out to you by email, phone, social media, online communities, or real-time Web chat. These different ways of reaching out are called channels, and they help you help your customers through their preferred communication tool. Giving your customers a choice in how they communicate with your company is the first step towards delivering extraordinary service.
The second step to delivering extraordinary service is making sure that your support team can work comfortably with multiple channels simultaneously. The last thing you want to do is burn out your support agents with a complicated app frustrated support agents don’t provide first-rate service. That’s why Service Cloud integrates multiple channels into an easy to use help desk called the console, which you can customize to fit your company’s unique support processes.</h7>

	<div> <h1> Platform as a Service</h1></div>
	Cloud 9 provides a computing platform and/or solution stack typically including operating system, programming language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS offers, the underlying compute and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand such that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually.</h7>

	<h1> Infrastructure as a Service</h1>
	Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
